## 📱 Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | 90+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Firefox | 88+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Safari | 14+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Edge | 90+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Mobile | Modern | ✅ Responsive |

**Requirements**:

## 🎯 Design Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **localStorage only** | No backend needed; instant MVP; easier testing |
| **React hooks** | Simpler than Redux; sufficient for app complexity |
| **ISO 8601 timestamps** | Timezone-safe; sortable; standard format |
| **Single storage key** | Simpler CRUD; easier to backup/restore |
| **95% quota threshold** | Prevents "storage full" surprises |
| **Modal for forms** | Clear boundaries; prevents accidental navigation |
| **Spanish-first UI** | Target audience; native language preference |
| **Tabbed layout** | Clear organization; easy tab switching |

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

✅ **Privacy First**
- Zero external tracking
- No analytics/telemetry
- Local storage only
- No third-party APIs except Google
- User data never sold

⚠️ **Considerations**
- XSS vulnerable if inputs aren't sanitized (currently using textContent)
- HTTPS recommended for production
- Users should backup their data manually
- localStorage not encrypted (browser's responsibility)
